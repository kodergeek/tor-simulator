# tor-simulator
This is a pretty old  academic project that I wrote as a course homework for distributed systems to simulate torrent protocol, 
mainly how nodes exchange data and download different parts of file and report it to seeder. Unfortunately my memory is rather cloudy about the details
to run the project:

`cd main/java`

`javac com/sina/torrentsim/*`

`java com.sina.torrentsim.SimulatorRunner`
